Objective
Develop a behavioral biometric authentication system that verifies user identity based on their unique typing patterns, ensuring secure and personalized access to systems.
â€¢ Key Features

1. Data Capture: Record keystroke dynamics, including typing speed, key press duration, and time between key presses.

2. Model Development: Create a machine learning model that analyzes and learns the user's typing pattern.

3. Authentication: Compare real-time typing data with stored patterns to grant or deny access.
